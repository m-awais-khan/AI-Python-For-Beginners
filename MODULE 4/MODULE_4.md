# Extending Python with Packages and APIs

### The Power of Shared Code

One of the reasons Python has become so popular is the vast ecosystem of code written and shared by developers across the world. Instead of writing everything from scratch, programmers can build on this collective work to accelerate development. Python provides tools that allow easy downloading and installation of this third-party code, which is usually bundled together in the form of **packages**.

By installing a package, a programmer immediately gains access to additional functions and features. For example, if the task is to download a web page and extract its text, there are freely available packages that make this possible with just a few lines of code. These ready-made solutions save both time and effort.

### Packages and Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)

While many packages install code that runs locally on your own computer, an important category of packages provides access to **Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)**. An API enables your code to communicate with other programs or services running on remote computers via the internet.

APIs make it possible to:

- **Retrieve Information**: For instance, request real-time weather data from a weather service, fetch the latest news, check stock prices, or even perform a web search.
- **Perform Actions**: APIs can be used to send text messages, deliver emails, or even place online shopping orders that result in physical goods being shipped to a recipient.

Through APIs, programmers extend their applications beyond local computation and directly interact with external systems.

### Collaboration and Collective Progress

Programming has always advanced by reusing and extending the work of others. This shared approach, often described as “standing on the shoulders of giants,” allows modern developers to achieve results that would otherwise take immense amounts of time to reproduce individually. Packages and APIs embody this principle by making powerful tools available to anyone who wishes to use them.

### AI Assistance in Package and API Usage

With the availability of AI tools, identifying the right packages or APIs for a given task has become easier. Developers can now receive recommendations on which packages to use and even get help writing the code required to integrate them into their projects.

### Expanding Python’s Capabilities

As programmers explore packages and APIs, the range of tasks Python can perform expands dramatically. Installing packages locally allows any computer to access these new capabilities. The starting point for this process lies in understanding the **import** command in Python, which enables the integration of external code into a program.
